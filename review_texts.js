        albumArtist: "Basement Jaxx",
        tldr: `Basement Jaxx is the anthithesis of minimalism. <i>Rooty</i> delivers a collection of disco, pop, and EDM that is part funky, part freaky, and completely unique.`,
        main: `Basement Jaxx sounds like Aphex Twin put on a Motown record, downed a couple sodas, and had a fling with Daft Punk. The duo's (Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe) music is just that restless, with a honest personality evident from their straightforward lyrics and an audible knack for eclectically sampling dance music sourced from across the globe. Soulful opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjgWpWulkt8">"Romeo"</a> channels Bollywood in its four-on-the-floor, seventh-chord magic. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-ElRX1lglE">"Breakaway"</a> skittishly longs to set itself free of circumstances that aren't exactly clear but are seemingly oppressively lonely.
        <br><br>
        The highlight of <i>Rooty</i> is "SFM" (an anacronym for Sexy Feline Machine)—a track that embodies its namesake, in which a soft bassline creeps beneath an assortment of energetic ad-libs that accompany a host of suggestive metaphors ("She's an angel, she's a dove / With a taste for villain's blood"). Other highlights on the album include the synth-bending "Crazy Girl" and the closing "All I Know", which happily strums away to a light-hearted affirmation: "My heart screams softly for you."
        <br><br>
        If anything's screaming softly here, it's the passion for creativity Buxton and Ratcliffe inject into each and every track on <i>Rooty</i>. Even the album's lower points (like the <i>Mario Kart</i>–esque <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FKZJlvbZXg">"I Want U"</a>) need more than fervent vocal riffs to be satisfied. Instead, they go wild with background details like cowbells, synthetic horns, and tiny video game bleeps an attentive listener would only catch after three or four re-listens. In an era where pop and alternative rock dominated the UK charts, <i>Rooty</i> stood in its trajectory with a proud smirk and its hands on its hips—when it wasn't grooving out.`,
