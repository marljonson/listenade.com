      The year was 2014, and the alternative hipster aesthetic was all the rage. Taylor Swift had just released her fifth album, <i>1989</i>, and it was a chart-topping success. Singles like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg">Blank Space</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk">Style</a>" highlighted Swift's maximalist pop sensbilities, pushing back the introspective songwriting that earned her critical acclaim for past albums like <i>Red</i> and <i>Speak Now</i> (the former of which received a nod for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/grammys-2014-winners-list-674152/">Album of the Year</a> by the Grammys in 2013). But perhaps 1989's defining feature was the mastermind behind its production—Swedish heavyweight Max Martin.

      Musically, <i>1989</i> took a sharp turn from Swift's previous works, forgoing her country roots (or so she portrayed herself to have) in exchange for a superstar idealization of herself. By forgoing the intimacy of the acoustic guitar, Swift undertook a new persona defined by shimmering synths and powerful electronic production inspired by artists like Janet Jackson and <a href="https://medium.com/cuepoint/the-oral-history-of-taylor-swift-s-1989-d9869cc13adc#.cd4wstjmz">Daft Punk</a>. Such a defining shift in Swift's image led publications to review <i>1989</i> through an extra-critical lens—and it made Swift the target of considerable rockist scrutiny. Critics who hailed her down-to-earth musical themes now questioned her validity as a truthful artist.
