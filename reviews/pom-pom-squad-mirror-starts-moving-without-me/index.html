                <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>Frontwoman Mia Berrin floats down a rabbit hole of melancholia in her brooding concept album, wrestling with the troubles that followed her to adulthood.
            </div>
            <br>
            Pom Pom Squad's Mia Berrin really loves <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. After she saw the 1951 Disney adaptation as a child, Berrin themed her <i>bat mitzvah</i> in its likeness. Desiring to explore and represent her sense of self with no barriers, Berrin's sophomore album <i>Mirror Starts Moving Without Me</i> portrays her as the titular character, Alice, creeping her way through an air of melancholia—and reverse-engineering the same emotions that defined her project's debut album in 2021.
            <br><br>
            Berrin shines when she chants mockingly, when she's posh, when she's dishing it out on a hater—essentially, sarcasm is her strong suit, and she plays it like a pro. In the ill-tempered "Street Fighter", she taunts her ex over a playful, uptempo breakbeat: she can hit you with that <i>up, down, up, down, left, right!</i>, an ode to the Japanese video game cheat code. And in "Spinning", she punches above her weight, with topsy-turvy vocal harmonies reminiscent of Olivia Rodrigo's "Get Him Back!".
            <br><br>
            A highlight of the album is "Doll Song", a heartfelt ballad in three-quarter time. The bridge interpolates <i>The Sound of Music</i>, and it's fitting; like Maria to each of the von Trapp kids, Berrin wants to comfort a younger version of herself, yearning to have been treated less awfully by a lover who once played with her emotions as if they were toys. Berrin wields her fragile voice like a single thread, fighting for visibility in the dark, suffocating her worst memories by the neck until the skin on her own fingers begins to hurt from pulling so tightly.
            <br><br>
            Other songs aren't as brought-to-life. In both the moderately paced "Everybody's Moving On" and the rock-themed opener "Downhill", her singing is clouded by uninspired instrumentals. For a concept album so personal to Berrin, the tracks feel devoid of vocal creativity, deprived of that sort of biting tonality that gives her music a grittier appeal she knows just how to execute.
            <br><br>
            Fortunately, she channels her better ideas into songs like the bratty "Villain", the 2000s-era rock anthem "Messages", and the skittish "Running From Myself". At the bottom of her rabbit hole, Berrin finds herself with fragments of thoughts that are stronger as a composite than as individual parts. She's been cut up by cards, spilt on by teacups, enlightened by lamps; when she settles at the bottom of it all, she finally accepts the truth that there's no turning back.
