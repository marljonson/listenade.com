                <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>Like a soft gust of wind, Clairo's <i>Immunity</i> touches on many emotions but leaves everything upright as it weaves through the people, places, and things in her life.
            </div>
            <br>
        Clairo's <i>Immunity</i> is a quietly confident exploration of indie pop's emotional range. Tracks like "Bags" and "Alewife" balance lo-fi charm with polished production, where her soft vocals cut through like a cool breeze.
        The introspective lyrics touch on love, identity, and vulnerability, but without wallowing in self-pity. A
        little fragile, a little grounded, it's a triumph in low-key tone and texture.
        <br><br>
        Some songs on <i>Immunity</i> are, in fact, susceptible to a few questionable choices. "White Flag" sees Clairo sing over an engagingly sidechained, almost-hip-hop beat that unfortunately outshines her lyrics. On "Impossible", she sings through a processed filter mismatched with her musical identity. And in the middle of the song "Sofia", a growling bass at the minute-and-a-half mark drains the song of its amiable sapphic vibe she'd been cultivating over a mellow disco beat.
