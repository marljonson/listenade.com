    Beabadoobee's <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is a confessional wrapped in jangly guitars. The album is raw, messy, and honest, with most tracks pulsating with the kind of vulnerability that comes from growing up and figuring out who you are. Her lyrics are often shallow, like diary entries set to music, but there's a blend of angst and dreaminess that doesn't feel forced—just a natural reflection of life's ups and downs. From the grungy "Care" to the softer "Sorry," it's an emotional rollercoaster, but it's one of those wooden ones that would really thrill if it had higher highs.
    <br><br>
    Sonically, the album is a nod to '90s alt-rock. It's polished yet lo-fi, soothing but kind of gritty. Beabadoobee's voice is sweet yet raw, almost fragile in moments, but always confident. <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is like an old mixtape from a friend who really gets it—perfectly imperfect, sometimes messy, but always real. Every note is a story, every strum an emotion, and they make <i>Fake It Flowers</i> a decent debut effort.
