                <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>Where substance costs twenty bucks, the 1975 comes up short. Not to worry, however, since the quartet always has a shiny trick up its sleeve.

            If I had to describe the 1975's debut album in one word, it'd be "shiny". They're evidently very ambitious,
            blending '80s synth-pop, post-punk, and ambient electronica into something that absolutely works. It's the
            musical equivalent of throwing a bunch of cool stuff in a blender and pressing "pulse" once. The band
            straddles contradictions: melancholy and celebration, atmospheric and brash, like the soundtrack to a night
            out in a dimly lit, half-empty nightclub where everyone's too cool to have fun.
            <br><br>
            What's truly impressive is how natural the 1975 makes their stuff sound. The album exudes a carefully
            crafted mood that's just pretentious enough to make you feel like you're in on some cool secret, or on the
            verge of some life-changing destiny you're just waiting for to happen. It's the kind of record
            that makes being confused about life sound stylishâ€”and somehow, that works.
            It's a little messy, but damn, it's a fun ride.
