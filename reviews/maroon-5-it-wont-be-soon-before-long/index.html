            <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>Five years after their soulful debut <i>Songs About Jane</i>, Maroon 5 returns with a second dose of their signature polished pop-rock sound. It's more electrified now, for better or worse.

        A motto to inspire the band's perserverance on tour, Maroon 5's <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> unveils a slick hipster twist of a sophomore album. Essentially, the band took the bachelor-in-love vibe from their catalog of hits ("Harder to Breathe", "This Love", etc.) and quantized it, freshened it up, gave it a cold shower. Despite this, Adam Levine's feeling more amorous now than ever.
        <br><br>
        There's a calculated kind of groove in tracks like opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGRbhegq2E0">"If I Never See Your Face Again"</a>, which first belonged to Janet Jackson before label compilcations arose. Maroon 5, albeit under distant lyrics, have literally suited up for a mature sound. Did you see the album cover? Levine and Co. are now professionals, and sonically, they make sure you know it—whatever the other guys' names are.
        <br><br>
        Like most of its Top 40 contemporaries, <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> frontloads the hits and leaves the ballads for the end. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTHX4BC7Qmk">"Back at Your Door"</a> sees Levine assume a doo-wop ethos as he croons to the other side of a bittersweet break-up. You can almost see him rocking around the stage, cradling the mic stand as he sings: "You penetrate right through me / Every time I wind up back at your door". And in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BuzHZtnmrI">"Better That We Break"</a>, it's nice to hear the band slow things down, but like the relationship sung about in this break-up anthem, it isn't anything special.
        <br><br>
        "Makes Me Wonder" and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lOAQb9T7t0">"Kiwi"</a>, the album's two standout tracks, showcase Maroon 5 at their fastest, funkiest, and least emotionally sober. "Kiwi" kicks off with a unique AABB scheme ("You're such a flirt, I know you hurt / And so do I, I empathize") and eventually weaves in Levine's affinity for healthy eating ("Sweet kiwi, your juice is dripping down my chin"). Just kidding, it's about something deeper—unlike Levine's killer falsetto on the hooky, romantically indecisive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWghUziic_A">"Makes Me Wonder"</a>.
        <br><br>
