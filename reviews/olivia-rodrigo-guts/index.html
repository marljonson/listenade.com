                <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>Olivia Rodrigo reaches a new high with sophomore album <i>Guts</i>, a fully realized (and musically mature) exploration of her less desirable self.
            </div>
            <br>
            Olivia Rodrigo's <i>Guts</i> is a stunning mess of emotional chaos wrapped in indie-rock vibes, and it feels
            like she's spent the last two years figuring out how to take her heartbreak and turn it into a whole new art
            form. The album's a little more self-aware than 2021's <i>Sour</i>—it's not just about crying over a breakup
            anymore; it's about navigating the messy, unpredictable experience of growing up. Tracks like "Vampire" and
            "Bad Idea Right?" are pure emotional rollercoasters that blend angst with a deep sense of reflection. She's
            grown, but she's still questioning everything: herself, her choices, and, of course, those annoying people
            who've messed with her along the way. The lyrics are razor-sharp, not afraid to poke fun at her own
            confusion while managing to hit you right in the gut (pun intended).
            <br><br>
            What sets <i>Guts</i> apart from her debut is how unafraid Olivia is to play with her sound. The album
            ranges from indie-rock anthems to folky, stripped-back moments that showcase her raw vulnerability. "Lacy"
            feels like a confession, while "Get Him Back!" plays like an over-the-top tantrum, showing just how far
            she's willing to go in both emotional extremes and musical experimentation. The production is lush and often
            dark, with flourishes of alt-rock that hint at everything from Tori Amos to early 2000s pop-punk.
            <br><br>If <i>Sour</i> was a diary, <i>Guts</i> is a scrapbook of emotional growth: messy, complicated, and sometimes
            even a little funny—just like being a teenager trying to figure out who the hell she is.
