            <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>After a series of five EPs, Beabadoobee's debut full-length sounds more like a sixth EP. But it's a fun, grungy record showcasing her potential as a singer-songwriter.

        Beabadoobee's <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is a collection of confessionals wrapped in jangly guitars. It's raw, messy, and honest, pulsating with the kind of vulnerability that comes from growing up and figuring out who you are. Though her lyrics are often shallow, like diary entries set to music, there's an angsty dreaminess that comes naturally to Beabadoobee when reflecting on life's ups and downs. From the grungy "Care" to the softer "Sorry," it's an emotional rollercoaster. But, like one of those classic wooden ones, it'd thrill you for real if it could throw you for a loop.
        <br><br>
        Always observant and mostly self-assured, Beabadoobee likes to reminisce on who she used to be and who she'd like to be with, if not already imagining it in her head. On songs like "Worth It" and "Charlie Brown", she confides about a new crush and clamors against her former <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/12/23/beabadoobee-fake-it-flowers-album-review-article/">habit of self-harm</a>. Because her intonation is a little lackluster, and the lyrics sort of vague, she tends to latch onto the grungy drums and guitar crunches of songs like "Together" and "Sorry".
        <br><br>
        Sonically, the album is a nod to '90s alt-rock. It's polished yet lo-fi, soothing but kind of gritty. Beabadoobee's voice is sweet yet raw, almost fragile in moments. <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is like an old mixtape from a friend who really gets itâ€”imperfect, sometimes messy, but always real. Every note is a story, every strum an emotion. All together, <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is a decent debut effort from the budding rock star.
