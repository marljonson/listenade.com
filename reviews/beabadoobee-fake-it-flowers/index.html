            <b>[TL;DR]</b><br>After a series of five EPs, Beabadoobee's debut full-length sounds more like a sixth EP. But it's a fun, grungy record showcasing her potential as a singer.

        Beabadoobee's <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is a collection of confessionals wrapped in jangly guitars. It's raw, messy, and honest, pulsating with the kind of vulnerability that comes from growing up and figuring out who you are. Though her lyrics are often shallow (like diary entries set to music), there's an angsty dreaminess that comes naturally to Beabadoobee when reflecting on life's ups and downs. From the grungy "Care" to the softer "Sorry," it's an emotional rollercoaster. But it's one of those wooden rollercoasters that'd thrill you for real if it could throw you for a loop.
        <br><br>
        Sonically, the album is a nod to '90s alt-rock. It's polished yet lo-fi, soothing but kind of gritty. Beabadoobee's voice is sweet yet raw, almost fragile in moments, but always confident. <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is like an old mixtape from a friend who really gets itâ€”imperfect, sometimes messy, but always real. Every note is a story, every strum an emotion. All together, <i>Fake It Flowers</i> is a decent debut effort from the 20-year-old.
