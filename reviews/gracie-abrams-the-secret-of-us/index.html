                <b>TL;DR:</b><i> The Secret of Us</i> showcases a set of brief songs, some warm and others cool, that find Abrams in her pocket compositionally.
            </div>
            <br>
            <i>The Secret of Us</i> is the kind of album you'd listen to while staring out a rain-soaked
            window, contemplating your life choices—but in a good way. It's often emotional, sometimes delicate, and
            always melancholic, with Abrams' straightforward voice weaving through lyrics like a well-worn sweater. There's more to this album than anything else put out by her.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I0M5R8HleQ">"Blowing Smoke"</a> jealously chugs along a reflection
            of an ex's new girl; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxLL899ANFM">"Risk"</a> finds a pep in her
            step as she pursues a novel love interest for herself. She's generically confessional; her uncomplicated
            songwriting is like a collection of diary entries. She balances heartbreak with self-empowerment, and while it feels undercooked sometimes, it's never overdone.
            <br><br>
            There are glimpses of a real pop star in <i>The Secret of Us</i>. On the upbeat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRcmNuWJ1-s">"Close to You"</a>, a last-minute addition to the album, she yearns for romantic connection, no matter how risky ("Pull the trigger on the gun I gave you when we met / Just let me be close to you"). And in the waltzing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od5qQ84pKIo">"I Love You, I'm Sorry"</a>, she imagines with a gentle regret what it'd be like to rekindle an old relationship. Abrams clearly paid attention during English, because while she's no Pulitzer Prize winner, her voice as a songwriter is engaging.
            <br><br>
            Besides her vocal clarity, Abrams' greatest strength is being relatable. She pulls you in with her acoustic
            indie charm and keeps you with her soft vulnerability, reminiscent of Taylor Swift's earlier works. The
            album's melodies are low-key but catchy, underpinned by glistening self-harmonizations that elevate Abrams'
            music beyond her just-average songwriting. <i>The Secret of Us</i> is more than just a collection of sad
            girl anthems; it’s a highly listenable soundtrack to your best "thinking about life" moments.
