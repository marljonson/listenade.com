    Hayley Williams, Paramore's <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/see-paramore-with-brand-new-eyes-268142/">fiery</a> 19-year-old frontwoman, revealed in 2008 through a blog post: she found herself doubting her ability to meet label expectations following the smashing success of the band's sophomore album <i>Riot!</i> released a year prior. Coupled with the turmoil between herself and fellow post-adolescent band members York, Davis, and the Farro brothers, Williams' emotional growth laid the groundwork for Paramore's third album.
    <br><br>
    First assembled sans the professional supervision of a producer, Paramore's <i>Brand New Eyes</i> feels like a raw, emotional dive into the band’s inner turmoil and growth. The album kicks off with “Careful,” a punchy track that sets the tone for the whole record—restless, urgent, and full of sharp truths. Hayley Williams' voice is as fierce as ever, effortlessly switching between vulnerability and power. It’s a battle cry, one of self-discovery and against her prior belief that every askew piece of her life would fall into place. The band’s sound is tighter, more polished, but still maintains that unmistakable edge that propelled <i>Riot!</i> to quadruple-platinum sales.
    <br><br>
    Songs like “Ignorance” and “The Only Exception” show off the band’s versatility. The former hits hard, a fiery anthem of frustration, while the latter slows things down into a tender ballad that feels almost like a sigh. <i>Brand New Eyes</i> captures the messiness of relationships—whether they’re with people, places, or even yourself. It's full of an energy that begs to be heard. You can feel the growth, the tension, and the catharsis all in one album. Paramore went out to prove themselves more than just a punk-pop band—they were more mature now, a force to be reckoned with.
