                <b>TL;DR:</b> While it's no Pulitzer Prize–winner, <i>The Secret of Us</i> showcases a set of warm, brief songs that find Abrams in her pocket compositionally.

            <i>The Secret of Us</i> is the kind of album you'd listen to while staring out a rain-soaked
            window, contemplating your life choices—but in a good way. It's often emotional, sometimes delicate, and
            always melancholic, with Abrams' straightforward voice weaving through tracks like a well-worn sweater.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I0M5R8HleQ">"Blowing Smoke"</a> jealously chugs along a reflection of an ex's new girl; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxLL899ANFM">"Risk"</a> finds a pep in her step as she pursues a novel love interest for herself. She's generically confessional; her uncomplicated songwriting is like a collection of diary entries. She balances heartbreak with self-empowerment, and while it's never overdone, sometimes it feels undercooked.
            <br><br>
            Besides her vocal clarity, Abrams' greatest strength is being relatable. She pulls you in with her acoustic indie charm and keeps you with her soft vulnerability, reminiscent of Taylor Swift's earlier works. The album's melodies are low-key but catchy, underpinned by glistening self-harmonizations that elevate Abrams' music beyond her just-average songwriting. <i>The Secret of Us</i> is more than just a collection of sad girl anthems; it’s an accessible soundtrack to your best "thinking about life" moments.
